**Source code** is the general term for what programemrs write. Of course, computers don't undestand source code, they only understand binary - information represented in binary. The techincal term now for language that computers understand is called **machine code.**

Source code is the input, the output is machine code (put diagram). The purpose of compilers is to convert source code to machine code.

Your source code should be correct, well designed, and styled well - the aesthetics of your code.

For CS50, we use VSCode to write our code, this will be our text editor. VSCode has within it a terminal window. A terminal window provides what is generally called a CLI, a command-line interface. This is in contrast with a GUI (a graphical user interface) - we use GUIs every single day - on our phones, computers, it's just graphical - menus, icons, buttons - we use our fingers or a mouse to interact with it. Yet most programmers come to prefer CLIs over time, where you do everything (somewhat arcanly) with a keyboard alone. Why? There's more features built in to most computers if you can access them with a keyboard - you can also type faster than you can point and click. Over time, you can get comfortable using your terminal window.

Functions have arguments and sometimes side effects. For exampe, printing out 'hello world' is a side effect. In C, with "hello, world\n"
